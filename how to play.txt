A game by Mathieu, an amateur game developer.


0. Warning
----------

Please note that if you want to use this game on real hardware, you will need
to fix the header - but that shouldn't be a problem, as flash linker software
does that automagically... No ?

It should also work fine on almost all emulators - at least Mappy and
Boycott Advance.


1. How to play ?
----------------


You can skip the introduction screen pressing start.

1.1. The Menus
--------------

The "menu" screen is quite easy to master : each slot on the bottom left
of the console corresponds to one of the characters on the screen - from left
to right : J0hn, Kay, HCR and Eluf (okay, I have no imagination for names...).
With the paddle, you can select the class of the character : it can be a human
player, a basic, I-play-a-random-card AI (AI rand), or a more advanced AI (AI
norml). The class you selected appears as a sphere on the bottom right corner
of the screen.

Once you press "A", the corresponding slot on the left gets filled by a reduced
version of that sphere - meaning that the corresponding character will be of
the class you selected.

If you press "B", the slot will be released - it permits you to cancel your
choice.

If you select a "player" - human player, another menu comes, where you can
enter your name. When you're OK with your name, press "start", and you shall
go back to the previous menu. Your name needs to be at least 3 characters, and
at most 4. For each letter, you can : go back to the previous one, pressing 
"B" ; select it slowly with the paddle, circulate fast through the letters with
the L and R shoulder buttons ; and go to the next letter pressing "A".

When you have selected all four players, the bottom-right sphere changes to
"OK". If you press start, the game starts ! Pressing B will work as usual.


1.2. The Game
-------------

1.2.1. Basics
-------------

The display has been designed with a pseudo-3D view in mind : this means that
you see your three opponents "in front" of you, with their cards. Your own
cards lie at the bottom of the screen.

On the top-right corner, a semi-translucent frame will display the cards that
have been played in the current trick.

A triangle will display the card you have selected to play. It might become a
cross if you can't currently play the card.


As you can play with several human friends, a mechanism has been designed in
order to prevent them from watching your cards : when you have finished your
turn, your cards will scroll down and become invisble to everyone until your
next turn !

Moreover, at the beginning of each human player's turn, a window will pop-up
in front of the screen, waiting for him/her to press "start" before showing up
his/her cards.


At the end of each trick, another window pops up and summarizes the trick,
showing you which cards have been played by who.

You'll notice that the cards are displayed in a special way (either in this
window or in the frame we discussed before) : the card slightly to the bottom
is the card J0hn has just played, the one slightly to the top is HCR's one,
the one to the left is Kay's one, and the one to the right is Eluf's one.

Imagine the four players around a table : J0hn in front, where you stand, Kay
on the left, HCR at the other side, and Eluf on the right. The card
positionning represents that :-).


1.2.2. The First Round : giving away three cards
------------------------------------------------

But first, you need to give three cards.

Pop out the "Player xyzt, it's your turn" window - pressing "Start", and choose
three cards to give away. You can circulate through the cards one by one using
the paddle, or fast using L and R shoulder buttons. Each card you select with
"A" or "B" raises up, select it once more and it will go down again. Whence you
will have selected three cards, the cursor changes into some kind of arrow -
press start to confirm that you want to give the three cards you selected, and
"A" or "B" otherwise...

When each player has done so, the game starts !


1.2.3. The tricks
-----------------

Choose the card you want to play with the arrows - or the shoulders, and press 
"A" or "B" to confirm. The card will be played immediately - so don't make any
mistake :-).

When all 4 players will have done this, the "trick window" will pop-up. If you
play with friends, don't forget to show them the result - it's important to
know who played what !


1.2.4. End of match, end of game
--------------------------------

The match ends when all the cards are played. The game ends when one player
scores over 100.


1.3. Strategy
-------------

You'll find fast that the AIs are not very, very smart... If you want to
progress in this game, find other human players !


4. Conclusion
-------------

Thanks for reading, and have fun playing Hearts Cafe !
