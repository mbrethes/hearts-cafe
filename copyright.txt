The source code contained in this archive is released for educational
purposes. This means :

You can:
- read the source code,
- edit it,
- build/compile it,
- change the gfx, add sound, etc.
- play with the nifty rom you just created,
- pass the binary and/or source code to your friends, just to show
  them how bad I am at programming, and as long as you don't modify
  this copyright notice.
- correct the bugs :-p

You can't:
- modify this copyright notice or remove it from the archive.
- change 3 lines of code and distribute it saying "I made that nifty
  program". Look, plagiarism is not a good way to learn things. And
  do you honestly think you can gain popularity in the community by
  doing that ?
- take me as responsible of whatever may happen on behalf of reading
  the source code, building it, and executing it (either on emulator
  or on the real GBA). This includes mental diseases due to the vision
  of the source code and headaches due to head banging on
  walls of any kind (including, but not limited to, wood, concrete, and
  plastic) after trying to understand the logic behind the AI.

You may:
- contact me if you have any questions.
- read the fscking readme.txt first, of course.
